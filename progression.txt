First regression attempt:

Had dupe columns (efg%, onoff efg%, ft%) being duplicated across csv files
Tried to just run lasso on 300 features, got nonsense results

Second attempt:

Tried to use MI, got dupe features and some features dropped entirely
Tried to force MI to pick one per skill group, got weird answers
Regression also gave me super low, nonsense weights

Third attempt:

Tried to use just the _weighted category, went better. Got the following top 10:
efg%_rank_weighted                                       0.070552
usage_rank_weighted                                      0.057202
astd%_rim_overall_rank_weighted                          0.033969
blk%_rank_weighted                                       0.021510
rim_frequency_rank_weighted                              0.016145
long_mid_accuracy_rank_weighted                          0.015431
onoff_team_team_fg%:_rim_rank_weighted                   0.014075
onoff_team_shot_frequency:_corner_three_rank_weighted    0.007845
corner_three_frequency_rank_weighted                     0.007836
offense:_ft_rate_rank_weighted                           0.002994

Still super low weights but supports four factors a bit more. Long mid also makes sense because of 2000s noise + salary/shot map

Fourth attempt:

Using simple spearman correlation to select feature category, then running lasso. Definitely not final attempt but useful to compare w/ raw weighted run

Fifth attempt:

Using random forest on spearman correlation selected categories, then running lasso
